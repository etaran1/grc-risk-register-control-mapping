# Control Mapping (Example)

## Framework Reference (high-level)
- CIS Controls (v8) style mapping (conceptual)
- NIST CSF style mapping (conceptual)

| Risk ID | Control Theme | Example Control | Status | Evidence |
|--------|----------------|----------------|--------|---------|
| R-001 | Access Control | MFA for remote access | Partial | Admin MFA configured |
| R-002 | Logging/Monitoring | Central log collection + retention | Missing | N/A |
| R-003 | Vulnerability Mgmt | Patch SLA + reporting | Missing | N/A |
| R-004 | IAM Governance | Quarterly access reviews | Missing | N/A |

## Notes
- Keep mapping simple and defensible.
- Focus on evidence you can actually produce.
